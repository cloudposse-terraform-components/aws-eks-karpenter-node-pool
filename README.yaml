# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component deploys [Karpenter NodePools](https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodepools/) to an EKS cluster.

  Karpenter is still rapidly evolving. At this time, this component only supports a subset of the features
  available in Karpenter. Support could be added for additional features as needed.

  Not supported:

  - Elements of NodePool:
    - [`template.spec.kubelet`](https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodepools/#spectemplatespeckubelet)
  - Elements of NodeClass:
    - `subnetSelectorTerms`. This component only supports selecting all public or all private subnets of the referenced
      EKS cluster.
    - `securityGroupSelectorTerms`. This component only supports selecting the security group of the referenced EKS
      cluster.
    - `amiSelectorTerms`. Such terms override the `amiFamily` setting, which is the only AMI selection supported by this
      component.
    - `instanceStorePolicy`
    - `associatePublicIPAddress`
usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  If provisioning more than one NodePool, it is
  [best practice](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/karpenter/#creating-nodepools) to create NodePools that are
  mutually exclusive or weighted.
